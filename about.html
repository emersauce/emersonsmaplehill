            <p>We are Jeff and Beth Emerson. We bought our land in Northern Wisconsin in 2001, and a few years later started sugaring (making maple syrup) with the encouragement of a friend who noticed how plentiful sugar maples were in our woods.</p>
            <h2>Locally Sourced</h3>
            <p>We own and manage 40 acres of hardwoods for sustainable syrup production and wildlife habitat. 
            We also produce syrup for local land owners who bring us sap from their trees.</p>
            <h2>Generational View</h2>
            <p>A 'crop tree' takes at least 30 years to become a productive sap tree.
                We manage our woods so it will be healthy and productive for generations to come.</p>
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>Our mission is to bring great maple syrup from our woods to your home. To boil sap, we burn wood sourced from our woods or cull trees from the area harvested by a professional tree service. We use a reverse osmosis process to efficiently remove water from the sap, significantly reducing the energy demand for syrup production.</p>
